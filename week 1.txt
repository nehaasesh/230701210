a=input()
b=input()
c=int(a)
d=float(b)
print(c,type(c),sep=",")
print("{:0.1f}".format(d),type(d),sep=",")

Gain percent
Alfred buys an old scooter for Rs. X and spends Rs. Y on its repairs. If he sells the scooter for Rs. Z (Z>X+Y). Write a program to help Alfred to find his gain percent. Get all the above-mentioned values through the keyboard and find the gain percent.

Input Format:
The first line contains the Rs X
The second line contains Rs Y
The third line contains Rs Z
Sample Input:
10000
250
15000
Sample Output:
46.34 is the gain percent.

For example:
Input
Result
45500
500
60000
30.43 is the gain percent.


buys=int(input())
repair=int(input())
sells=int(input())
g=(((sells-(buys+repair))/(buys+repair))*100)
print("{:.2f}".format(g), "is the gain percent.")

Deposits
In many jurisdictions, a small deposit is added to drink containers to encourage people to recycle them. In one particular jurisdiction, drink containers holding one liter or less have a $0.10 deposit and drink containers holding more than one liter have a $0.25 deposit. Write a program that reads the number of containers of each size(less and more)  from the user. Your program should continue by computing and displaying the refund that will be received for returning those containers. Format the output so that it includes a dollar sign and always displays exactly two decimal places.
Sample Input
10
20
Sample Output
Your total refund will be $6.00.


For example:
Input
Result
20
20
Your total refund will be $7.00.




a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=a*0.1
d=b*0.25
e=c+d
print("Your total refund will be ${:.2f}.".format(e))

Carpenter
Justin is a carpenter who works on an hourly basis. He works in a company where he is paid Rs 50 for an hour on weekdays and Rs 80 for an hour on weekends. He works 10 hrs more on weekdays than weekends. If the salary paid for him is given, write a program to find the number of hours he has worked on weekdays and weekends.
Hint:
If the final result(hrs) are in -ve convert that to +ve using abs() function
The abs() function returns the absolute value of the given number.


number = -20
absolute_number = abs(number)
print(absolute_number)
# Output:20

 Sample Input:
450
Sample Output:
weekdays 10.38
weekend 0.38


For example:
Input
Result
450
weekdays 10.38
weekend 0.38




s=int(input())
a=(500-s)/130
print("weekdays {:.2f}".format(abs(a)+10))
print("weekend {:.2f}".format(abs(a)))
